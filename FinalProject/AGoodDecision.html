<h2> Reasons Why You Should Change Your Grades</h2>
<p> You can hack into the school system and change people's grades for many benefits. You can change 
your grades to get a higher GPA and to change others' grades and make money from it. You can do the 
things you want and still get a good grade. You don't have to be stressed out for an exam, you don't 
have to do homeworks if you don't have time, and you don't have to pay attention in class if you don't 
want to.
