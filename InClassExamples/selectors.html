            <ol>
                <li>Insert your own image instead of the el-capitan image that was originally inserted.  <em>Do NOT</em> use the url link, instead find an immage that you would like to link, download it and insert it into the page, inside of the container div</li>
                <li>There are three types of selectors, go to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp">w3schools Syntax</a> and name them here: (also include which tag each of these are associated with in this example)</li>

                    <li><em a class="purple">//the ID selector, (Ex. "#para1" , which highlights the first paragraph) //</em></li>
                    <li><em a class="purple">//the class selector (Ex. ".center" , which highlights all items in the center of page) //</em></li>
                    <li><em a class="purple">//the element selector (Ex. "p" , which highlights all paragrpahs) //</em></li>
                </ul>
                <li>Add a paragraph tag outside of the container and put some school appropriate text in it.</li>
                <li>What color was that text and why?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>color: <em a class="purple">//The color is white//</em></li>
                    <li>why? <em a class="purple">//The CSS file was linked to this HTML file. The coding stated for the text to be white. (See body, then color, then white)//</em></li>
                </ul>
                <li>When finished, turn in the url to the google classroom post for today.</li>
