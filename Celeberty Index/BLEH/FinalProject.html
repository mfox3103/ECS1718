<h1> Hacking The School System </h1>
<h2> <i> What Would You Do? </i> </h2>
<hr> 
<h3> <b> Changing Your Grades </b> </h3>
<p> You have the ability to hack into the school computer system.  
You can change a person's grades.  Would you change your own?  Why or why not?  
What if you could change the grade for a basketball player who has a scholarship to play 
for a big university?
</p>
<p> Some students have the ability to hack into the school grading system, allowing themselves
to change their grades or their classmates' grades. This situtation that these students have 
is a true test of their morals. </p>

<p> The real question is: <b>Is Altering You Grades For Your Benefit A Good Thing
or A Bad Thing? </b> </p>
